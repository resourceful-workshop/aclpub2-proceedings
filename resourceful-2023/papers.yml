- abstract: The progress made in computer-assisted linguistics has led to huge advances
    in natural language processing (NLP) research. This research often benefits linguistics
    in a broader sense, e.g., by digitizing pre-existing data and analyzing ever larger
    quantities of linguistic data in audio or visual form, such as sign language video
    data using computer vision methods. A large portion of research conducted on sign
    languages today is based in computer science and engineering, but much of this
    research is unfortunately conducted without any input from experts on the linguistics
    of sign languages or deaf communities. This is obvious from some of the language
    used in the published research, which regularly contains ableist labels. In this
    paper, I illustrate this by demonstrating the distribution of words in titles
    of research papers indexed by Google Scholar. By doing so, we see that the number
    of tech papers is increasing while the number of linguistics papers is (relatively)
    decreasing, and that ableist language is more frequent in tech papers. By extension,
    this suggest that much of the tech-related work on sign languages -- heavily under-researched
    and under-resourced languages -- is conducted without collaboration and consultation
    with deaf communities and experts, against ethical recommendations.

  title: Ableist Language Teching over Sign Language Research
- abstract: In this paper, we present the newly compiled DA-ELEXIS Corpus, which is
    one of the largest sense-annotated corpora available for Danish, and the first
    one to be annotated with the Danish wordnet, DanNet. The corpus is part of a European
    initiative, the ELEXIS project, and has corresponding parallel annotations in
    nine other European languages. As such it functions as a cross-lingual evaluative
    benchmark for a series of low and medium resourced European language. We focus
    here on the Danish annotation process, i.e. on the annotation scheme including
    annotation guidelines and a primary sense inventory constituted by DanNet as well
    as the fall-back sense inventory namely The Danish Dictionary (DDO). We analyse
    and discuss issues such as out of vocabulary (OOV) problems, problems with sense
    granularity and missing senses (in particular for verbs), and how to semantically
    tag multiword expressions (MWE), which prove to occur very frequently in the Danish
    corpus. Finally, we calculate the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) and show how
    IAA has improved during the annotation process. The openly available corpus contains
    32,524 tokens of which sense annotations are given for all content words, amounting
    to 7,322 nouns, 3,099 verbs, 2,626 adjectives, and 1,677 adverbs.

  title: The DA-ELEXIS Corpus - a Sense-Annotated Corpus for Danish with Parallel
    Annotations for Nine European Languages
- abstract: 'In this paper, we present an approach for translating word embeddings
    from a majority language into 4 minority languages: Erzya, Moksha, Udmurt and
    Komi-Zyrian. Furthermore, we align these word embeddings and present a novel neural
    network model that is trained on English data to conduct sentiment analysis and
    then applied on endangered language data through the aligned word embeddings.
    To test our model, we annotated a small sentiment analysis corpus for the 4 endangered
    languages and Finnish. Our method reached at least 56\% accuracy for each endangered
    language. The models and the sentiment corpus will be released together with this
    paper. Our research shows that state-of-the-art neural models can be used with
    endangered languages with the only requirement being a dictionary between the
    endangered language and a majority language.'

  title: What Causes Unemployment? Unsupervised Causality Mining from Swedish Governmental
    Reports
- abstract: 'The developments of deep learning in natural language processing (NLP)
    in recent years have resulted in an unprecedented amount of computational power
    and data required to train state-of-the-art NLP models. This makes lower-resource
    languages, such as Swedish, increasingly more reliant on language transfer effects
    from English since they do not have enough data to train separate monolingual
    models. In this study, we investigate whether there is any potential loss in English-Swedish
    language transfer by evaluating two types of language transfer on the GLUE/SweDiagnostics
    datasets and comparing between different linguistic phenomena. The results show
    that for an approach using machine translation for training there is no considerable
    loss in overall performance nor by any particular linguistic phenomena, while
    relying on pre-training of a multilingual model results in considerable loss in
    performance. This raises questions about the role of machine translation and the
    use of natural language inference (NLI) as well as parallel corpora for measuring
    English-Swedish language transfer. '

  title: Are There Any Limits to English-Swedish Language Transfer? A Fine-grained
    Analysis Using Natural Language Inference
- abstract: This paper explores the use of masked language modeling (MLM) for data
    augmentation (DA), targeting structured sentiment analysis (SSA) for Norwegian
    based on a dataset of annotated reviews. Considering the limited resources for
    Norwegian language and the complexity of the annotation task, the aim is to investigate
    whether this approach to data augmentation can help boost the performance. We
    report on experiments with substituting words both inside and outside of sentiment
    annotations, and we also present an error analysis, discussing some of the potential
    pitfalls of using MLM-based DA for SSA, and suggest directions for future work.

  title: Word Substitution with Masked Language Models as Data Augmentation for Sentiment
    Analysis
- abstract: With the advent of weakly supervised ASR systems like Whisper, it is possible
    to train ASR systems on non-verbatim transcriptions. This paper describes an effort
    to create a large Norwegian dataset for weakly supervised ASR from parliamentary
    recordings. Audio from Stortinget, the Norwegian parliament, is segmented and
    transcribed with an existing ASR system. An algorithm retrieves transcripts of
    these segments from Stortinget's official proceedings using the Levenshtein edit
    distance between the ASR output and the proceedings text. In that way, a dataset
    of more than 5000 hours of transcribed speech is produced with limited human effort.
    Since parliamentary data is public domain, the dataset can be shared freely without
    any restrictions.

  title: A Large Norwegian Dataset for Weak Supervision ASR
- abstract: Conventional approaches to the construction of word vectors typically
    require very large amounts of unstructured text and powerful computing hardware,
    and the vectors themselves are also difficult if not impossible to inspect or
    interpret on their own.  In this paper, we introduce a method for building word
    vectors using the framework of vector symbolic architectures in order to encode
    the semantic information in wordnets, such as the Open English WordNet or the
    Open Multilingual Wordnet.  Such vectors perform surprisingly well on common word
    similarity benchmarks, and yet they are transparent, interpretable, and the information
    contained within them has a clear provenance.

  title: Lexical Semantics with Vector Symbolic Architectures
- abstract: 'We present ongoing work dealing with a Linked Open Data (LOD) compliant
    representation of Sign Language (SL) data, with the goal of supporting the cross-lingual
    linking of SL data, also to Spoken Language data. As the European EASIER research
    project has already investigated the use of Open Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) datasets
    for cross-linking German and Greek SL data, we propose a unified RDF-based representation
    of OMW and SL data.  In this context, we experimented with the transformation
    into RDF of a rich dataset, which links Danish Sign Language data and the wordnet
    for Danish, DanNet. We extend this work to other Nordic languages, aiming at supporting
    cross-lingual comparisons of Nordic Sign Languages. This unified formal representation
    offers a semantic repository of information on SL data that could be accessed
    for supporting the creation of datasets for training or evaluating NLP applications
    that involve SLs.  '

- abstract: 'This paper examines the use of manually part-of-speech tagged sign language
    gloss data in the Text2Gloss and Gloss2Text translation tasks, as well as running
    an LSTM-based sequence labelling model on the same glosses for automatic part-of-speech

  title: Part-of-Speech tagging Spanish Sign Language data and its applications in
    Sign Language machine translation
- abstract: 'Negation constitutes a challenging phenomenon for many natural language
    processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis (SA). In this paper we investigate
    the relationship between negation and sentiment in the context of Norwegian professional
    reviews. The first part of this paper includes a corpus study which investigates
    how negation is tied to sentiment in this domain, based on existing annotations.
    In the second part, we introduce NoReC-NegSynt, a synthetically augmented test
    set for negation and sentiment, to allow for a more detailed analysis of the role
    of negation in current neural SA models. This diagnostic test set, containing
    both clausal and non-clausal negation, allows for analyzing and comparing models''
    abilities to treat several different types of negation. We also present a case-study,
    applying several neural SA models to the diagnostic data. '

  title: A Diagnostic Dataset for Sentiment and Negation Modeling for Norwegian
- abstract: The Open Multilingual Online Lexicon of Okinawan (OMOLO) project aims
    to create an accessible, user-friendly digital lexicon for the endangered Okinawan
    language using digital humanities tools and methodologies. The multilingual web
    application, available in Japanese, English, Portuguese, and Spanish, will benefit
    language learners, researchers, and the Okinawan community in Japan and diaspora
    countries such as the U.S., Brazil, and Peru. The project also lays the foundation
    for an Okinawan UD Treebank, which will support computational analysis and the
    development of language technology tools such as parsers, machine translation
    systems, and speech recognition software. The OMOLO project demonstrates the potential
    of computational linguistics in preserving and revitalizing endangered languages
    and can serve as a blueprint for similar initiatives.

  title: Building Okinawan Lexicon Resource for Language Reclamation/Revitalization
    and Natural Language Processing Tasks such as Universal Dependencies Treebanking
- abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved natural language
    processing (NLP) performance, but training these models from scratch is resource-intensive
    and challenging for smaller languages.

    With this paper, we want to initiate a discussion on the necessity of language-specific
    pre-training of LLMs.

    We propose how the "one model-many models" conceptual framework for task transfer
    can be applied to language transfer and explore this approach by evaluating the
    performance of non-Swedish monolingual and multilingual models'' performance on
    tasks in Swedish.

    Our findings demonstrate that LLMs exposed to limited Swedish during training
    can be highly capable and transfer competencies from English off-the-shelf, including
    emergent abilities such as mathematical reasoning, while at the same time showing
    distinct culturally adapted behaviour.

    Our results suggest that there are resourceful alternatives to language-specific
    pre-training when creating useful LLMs for small languages.'

  title: 'Bridging the Resource Gap: Exploring the Efficacy of English and Multilingual
    LLMs for Swedish'
- abstract: Obtaining information about loan words and irregular morphological patterns
    can be difficult for low-resource languages. Using Sakha as an example,  we show
    that it is possible to exploit known phonemic regularities such as vowel harmony
    and consonant distributions to identify loan words and irregular patterns, which
    can be helpful in rule-based downstream tasks such as parsing and POS-tagging.
    We evaluate phonemically inspired methods for loanword detection, combined with
    bi-gram vowel transition probabilities to inspect irregularities in the morphology
    of loanwords. We show that both these techniques can be useful for the detection
    of such patterns. Finally, we inspect the plural suffix -ЛАр [-LAr] to observe
    some of the variation in morphology between native and foreign words.

  title: Phonotactics as an Aid in Low Resource Loan Word Detection and Morphological
    Analysis in Sakha
- abstract: Internal representations in transformer models can encode useful linguistic
    knowledge about syntax. Such knowledge could help optimise the data annotation
    process. However, identifying and extracting such representations from big language
    models is challenging. In this paper we evaluate two multilingual transformers
    for the presence of knowledge about the syntactic complexity of sentences and
    examine different vector norms. We provide a fine-grained evaluation of different
    norms in different layers and for different languages. Our results suggest that
    no single part in the models would be the primary source for the knowledge of
    syntactic complexity. But some norms show a higher degree of sensitivity to syntactic
    complexity, depending on the language and model used.

  title: Vector Norms as an Approximation of Syntactic Complexity
- abstract: Natural language processing techniques can be valuable for improving and
    facilitating historical research. This is also true for the analysis of petitions,
    a source which has been relatively little used in historical research. However,
    limited data resources pose challenges for mainstream natural language processing
    approaches based on machine learning. In this paper, we explore methods for automatically
    segmenting petitions according to their rhetorical structure. We find that the
    use of rules, word embeddings, and especially keywords can give promising results
    for this task.

  title: Low-Resource Techniques for Analysing the Rhetorical Structure of Swedish
    Historical Petitions
- abstract: A crucial social characteristic that facilitates human-robot cooperation
    is gaze following. We propose a new approach to estimate gaze using a neural network
    architecture, while considering the dynamic patterns of real world gaze behaviour
    in natural interaction. The main goal is to provide a basis for robot or avatar
    to communicate with humans using multimodal natural dialogue. We generated 2.4M
    gaze predictions of various types of gaze in a more natural setting (GHI-Gaze).
    The predicted and categorised gaze data can be used to automate contextualized
    robotic gaze-tracking behaviour in interaction. We evaluate the performance on
    a manually-annotated data set and a publicly available gaze-follow dataset. Compared
    to previously reported methods our model performs better with the closest angular
    error to that of a human annotator.
